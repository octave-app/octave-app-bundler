# wip_bundle_octapp - Build one of our in-progress releases
#
#     wip_bundle_octapp <ver> [...args...]
#
# <ver> is the version/variant to build, in terms of short names used by this wip script.
# The beta/update suffix an other things are chosen from this.
#
# All other arguments are passed along to bundle_octave_app.
#
# Currently supported versions for <ver>:
#   * 'x' = whatever the current wip default version is
#   * 9.1
#   * 9.1-qt5
#   * 9.2
#   * 9.2-qt5
#   * 8.4
#
# As of 2024-05-20, I'm targeting Qt 5 for the main 9.1 release, since I'm having problems
# with Qt 6 and don't know how to fix them.
#
# This is a thin wrapper around bundle_octave which just calls it with the options
# for the build we're currently working on, so you don't have to remember to type
# them on the command line consistently each time.
#
# The "wip" comes first in the name so you don't accidentally mix up this wrapper
# and the main bundle_octave command in shell tab completion or history searches.
