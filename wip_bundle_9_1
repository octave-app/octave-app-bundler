# wip_bundle_octave_app - Build the Octave.app we're working on now.
#
# This is a thin wrapper around bundle_octave which just calls it with the options
# for the build we're currently working on, so you don't have to remember to type
# them on the command line consistently each time.
#
# The "wip" comes first in the name so you don't accidentally mix up this wrapper
# and the main bundle_octave command in shell tab completion or history searches.
