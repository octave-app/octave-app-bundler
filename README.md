# README â€“ octave-app-bundler

This repository contains the necessary files to build Octave.app (version >=4) using Homebrew.

If you're a user and just want to run Octave, you don't want this repo. Just go [here](https://octave-app.github.io/Download.html) to download the installer. (This repo just contains the tools that are used to build that installer.)

Alternately, you can use a package manager as described [here](http://wiki.octave.org/Octave_for_MacOS_X).

More general information about installing Octave is available at <http://wiki.octave.org/Create_a_MacOS_X_App_Bundle_Using_Homebrew>.

## Contact

This project is maintained by the [octave-app Organization](https://github.com/octave-app).
[Sebastian Schoeps](https://github.com/schoeps) developed the original code. [Andrew Janke](https://github.com/apjanke) is the primary maintainer as of 2020.

The home repo for this project is [octave-app/octave-app-bundler on GitHub](https://github.com/octave-app/octave-app-bundler). But bugs should be reported on the [Issue Tracker for the main octave-app project](https://github.com/octave-app/octave-app/issues).

Homebrew formulae used for Octave.app are in the [octave-app/octave-app tap](https://github.com/octave-app/homebrew-octave-app).

## Usage

Again, if you just want to use Octave, you should [download the pre-built binary](https://octave-app.github.io/Download.html) instead of running octave-app-bundler yourself.

For those who do want to bundle their own Octave.app:

Clone the [repo](https://github.com/octave-app/octave-app-bundler) recursively with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/octave-app/octave-app-bundler`, `cd` to it, and run `./bundle_octave_app`. The defaults will build an app using a recent version of Octave.

`bundle_octave_app` does have options, but they're mainly for use in debugging `bundle_octave_app` itself. They're not recommended for users, so avoid them unless you have a specific reason to use one. For details on the options, see `./bundle_octave_app --help`.

## Requirements and Dependencies

* macOS
* GNU sed (gsed)
* Python 3, with a `python3` command.
* [create-dmg](https://github.com/create-dmg/create-dmg)

GNU sed is not shipped with macOS. You'll need to install it with Homebrew, MacPorts, or something else. `brew install gnu-sed` will do it.

Recent versions of macOS (like macOS 12 and later) include Python 3. On earlier versions, you'll need to install it with Homebrew or something else.

This looks for create-dmg under `~/repos`. If you installed it somewhere else, point to it by setting the `$OCTAPP_CREATEDMG_HOME` environment variable.

## How it works

Octave-app-bundler uses Homebrew to build and install Octave and all its dependencies. This is done in a separate Homebrew prefix under the target application so it doesn't interfere with any existing Homebrew installations. It then bundles those programs as a macOS app bundle, and creates an installer DMG using andreyvit's [create-dmg tool](https://github.com/andreyvit/create-dmg).

## Miscellaneous

The word "bundler" as used in this project has nothing to do with Ruby's [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) tool for managing gems. It uses that word because it makes a macOS app bundle. It's just a collision of terminology; no Ruby is involved here.
