# wip_bundle_9_2 - Build 9.2 release (using Qt 6)
#
# As of 2024-06-24, I'm targeting Qt 5 for the main 9.2 release, since I'm having problems
# with Qt 6 and don't know how to fix them. This alternate build script is for making a
# Qt 6 version side-by-side for testing.
#
# This is a thin wrapper around bundle_octave which just calls it with the options
# for the build we're currently working on, so you don't have to remember to type
# them on the command line consistently each time.
#
# The "wip" comes first in the name so you don't accidentally mix up this wrapper
# and the main bundle_octave command in shell tab completion or history searches.
